A composer wrapper for ServerSideRender blocks

## Installation

`$ composer require ralfhortt/wp-block`

## Usage

There are two main ways to register WordPress blocks with this package:

1. **BlockManifest** - For registering multiple blocks from a manifest file (recommended for modern block development)
2. **Block** - For programmatic block registration with custom PHP rendering

## Examples

### BlockManifest Example

Use `BlockManifest` when you have a `block.json` file or a manifest that describes multiple blocks. This is the modern WordPress approach and integrates well with build tools.

```php
<?php
use RalfHortt\WPBlock\BlockManifest;

// Register blocks from a manifest file
(new BlockManifest(__DIR__ . '/build/blocks/blocks-manifest.php'))->register();
```

### Block Class Examples

Use the `Block` class for custom PHP-rendered blocks with full control over the rendering process.

```php
class MyBlock extends Block {
	protected string $name = 'ralfhortt/myotherblock';
	protected string $title = 'My other Block';
	protected string $blockJson = 'block.json';
	// â€¦
}

// Register your blocks (typically in your plugin's main file)
$myBlock = new MyBlock();
$myBlock->register();
```

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use BlockManifest when:**

- You have multiple blocks to register
- You're using modern block development with build tools
- You want to leverage WordPress's native `block.json` metadata
- You're building blocks with JavaScript/React components

**Use Block class when:**

- You need custom PHP rendering logic
- You're building server-side rendered blocks
- You want fine-grained control over block behavior
- You're migrating from legacy shortcode-based solutions

## Hooks

### Block Class Hooks

#### Actions

- `{$name}/before` - Before block output
- `{$name}/after` - After block output

#### Filters

- `{$name}/name` - Block name
- `{$name}/attributes` - Block attributes
- `{$name}/render` - Overwrite render callback

### BlockManifest Hooks

The `BlockManifest` class uses WordPress's native `init` action to register blocks. You can hook into the standard WordPress block registration process:

- `block_type_metadata` - Filter block metadata before registration
- `register_block_type_args` - Filter block registration arguments

## Development

### Requirements

- PHP 8.3 or higher
- Composer

### Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
composer test:coverage

# Run static analysis
composer phpstan

# Run full CI suite
composer ci
```

### Code Quality

This project uses:

- **PestPHP** for testing
- **PHPStan** for static analysis (level 8)
- **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration
- **Brain\Monkey** for WordPress function mocking
